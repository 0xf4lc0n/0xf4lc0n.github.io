Here I publicate my small university project. I was told to do a website on any topic from scratch. 
I decided to choose that kind of topic because my design skill practically doesn't exist. So I thought that I could made up for site's primitive design in interesting and original content but unfortunately that idea didn't do good. However, I think that the time which I spent on project wasn't wasted, because I had an oportunity to check my knowledge and skills. What is more I also had a chance to learn somenthing new.  

Project originally contained "Introduction page" but that page wasn't technical so I didn't published it on the blog. That page also contained a substantive error (Based on information from one source where author expressed his speculations about possible attack vectors, I presented that speculations as a sure thing).
